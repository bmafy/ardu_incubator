# ardu_incubator
This code is written for an Arduio MEGA 2560 with an Ethernet Shield on it.
It manages, in a quite simple way, an MQTT connection with a RPi over Ethernet protocols, exchanging data. It uses some Arduino library such as "Arduino Client for MQTT" (https://github.com/knolleary/pubsubclient) and "ArduinoJson" (https://github.com/bblanchon/ArduinoJson). Data are formatted in JSON (as you can imagine) due to its very easy parsing in Python (not so easy in Arduino.. but you know.. ;) ) 
Well! Take a look and leave a comment, buddy!
We will provide circuit design ASAP!
